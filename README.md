# Portfolio Yo

## What is this?

This is my [personal portfolio and blog](http://www.livingincircuits.co.uk). 
It uses [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) which is a blazing fast React.js static site generator
More blog than portfolio at the mo!

This was created in a few hours to see how quickly I could spin up a static website using React.js

## Install
- `yarn install`

## Run
- In development: `npm run develop`.
- Create a static build /public folder: `npm run build`.

## Build
This site is currently being built from the /docs folder in the master branch. [More Info](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)

## TODO
- Automate Docs upload :smiley:
- Add Projects :cold_sweat:
- IE Fallbacks :persevere:
