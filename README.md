# Portfolio Yo

## What is this?

This is my [personal portfolio and blog](http://www.livingincircuits.co.uk). 

It uses [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) which is a blazing fast React.js static site generator

This was initially created in a few hours to see how quickly I could spin up a static website using React.js

## Install
- `yarn install`

## Run
- In development: `npm run develop`.

## Build
- Create a static build public folder: `npm run build`. 

## Deploy

- Publish gh-pages branch: `npm run deploy`.

## TODO
- IE Fallbacks? :persevere:
