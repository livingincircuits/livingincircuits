# Portfolio Yo

## What is this?

This is my [personal portfolio and blog](http://www.livingincircuits.co.uk). 

It uses [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) which is a blazing fast React.js static site generator

More blog than portfolio at the mo!

This was created in a few hours to see how quickly I could spin up a static website using React.js

## Install

## Run
- In development: `npm run develop`.
