Navigation on the web sucks. Large websites can be hard to use and oftentimes send you to the wrong place. Most e-commerce websites I use are terrible at navigation.

As it currently stands maintaining separate location tools, in this case a main navigation and search on websites usually means one gets neglected as we think we have covered how to get to the content.

I have always been more search-dominant so if a website has a good search tool, i'll use that over a mega menu.

[Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/) get's it right in my opinion. You select the category you want, and search for what you want.

Another great example of search would be [Vans](http://vans.co.uk/). Their search is simple to use and easy to find. Their categorisation of products is also easy to follow so I have more options.

Search over navigation makes much more sense to me but I'm aware this isn't a catchall solution as people will habitually search for books, games, DVDs and CDs so products work (like Amazon and Vans) but possibly not pages, at least not yet.

I would love for a large product based website opt for search over navigation and it seems I am not alone in this thinking:

I don't know the future of navigation on the web but I think search will play a large part.
